The CoinValue App
In this app, you can check the current exchange rates of popular cryptocurrencies and find out how much a particular cryptocurrency has increased or decreased in price, represented as a percentage. There is also a built-in currency converter. Currently, the app is in development, with plans to obtain real-time currency ratios for the converter and further enhancements for other screens and ideas.

In development.
